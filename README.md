# Advent of code
My solutions for the puzzles written in [odin](https://odin-lang.org/).

## How to
Create the folder and files for a new puzzle for the current year:
```
make DAY=03 day
```

For a different year:
```
make YEAR=2021 DAY=03 day
```

Build and run a single puzzle:
```
cd YEAR/
odin build day0X/main.odin -file
time ./main.bin
```

## Show me your input
The input files differ for each user and shouldn't be public. Move them to each puzzles's fodler in `input.txt`

Have fun :)
