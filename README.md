# Advent of code
My solutions for the puzzles written in [odin](https://odin-lang.org/).

## How to
Create the folder and files for a new puzzle for the current year:
```
make DAY=03 day
```

For a different year:
```
make YEAR=2021 DAY=03 day
```

Run a single puzzle from cmd:
```
time /path/to/odin run 202X/day0X/main.odin -file
```
or from inside nvim:
```
:!time ../Odin/odin run % -file                                                                                                           
```

## Show me your input
The input files differ for each user and shouldn't be public. Move them to each puzzles's fodler in `input.txt`

Have fun :)
